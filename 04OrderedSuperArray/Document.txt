1. I checked that the insertionSort() does indeed work by

2a. In order to check the times for the two different sorts, I created a SuperArray in the main
and filled it with 20000 strings of a length between 1 and 10 with random chars. The chars are
upper and lower case letters, and the chars associated with values between Z's and a's respective
values. Then, i made it so that if there is one argument given, badInsertionSort() will happen,
and if there are two arguments given, insertionSort() will happen. The times logged (including time
taken to generate the SuperArray) using 24 as the seed value were:

badInsertionSort():
real	0m6.245s
user	0m6.080s
sys	0m0.379s

insertionSort():
real	0m4.074s
user	0m3.922s
sys	0m0.291s
